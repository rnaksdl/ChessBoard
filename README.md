# ChessBoard
Tired of playing 2D digital chess? Play 2D physical chess XD

## What's needed?
3D printer, Filament(PLA), 100 Pcs coin magnets(Diameter: 6.00 mm, Height: 2.00mm)<br />
and nail clipper(???)<br />
  I used a slanted edge nail clipper to remove extra filaments and that worked like a charm.

## Why did I make this?
I wanted a physical chess board, but didn't want to pay 

## What I learned
I think it's better to design things looser..?
  Initially I thought making things tighter and removing extra filaments might be better option
  But that just adds extra work(time) and using glue or just melting in more filament in was faster fix
  Specifically in my case, with my 3D printer (Anuycubic Kobra 2 Max), having things 1 mm leeway is generally a good idea.

DO NOT TOUCH THE PRINTER WHILE PRINTING!!!!!!!!
  I messed up the board because the printer was keep producing little blobs.
  So I kept pausing and removing those, BUT that must have mess up the location of the plate or something..
    it was better to just leave the blobs.

## in the future
it might be cool to be able to take the board apart in 4 pieces for better storage
  I might just cut mine ðŸ˜³
  the magenets will keep them together when stacked

# Version 1.1
The magnet slot was exactly 6.00 mm wide, which was too tight.
My 3D printer trinted the slots as about 5.00 mm wide.
So I updated them to be 7.00 mm wide.

# Version 1.0
Original design.
