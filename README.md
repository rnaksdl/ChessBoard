Tired of playing 2D digital chess? Play 2D physical chess XD

## What's needed?
3D printer, Filament(PLA), 100 Pcs coin magnets(Diameter: 6.00 mm, Height: 2.00mm)


# Version 1.1
The magnet slot was exactly 6.00 mm wide, which was too tight.
My 3D printer trinted the slots as about 5.00 mm wide.
So I updated them to be 7.00 mm wide.

# Version 1.0
Original design.
