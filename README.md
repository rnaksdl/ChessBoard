# ChessBoard
Tired of playing 2D digital chess? Play 2D physical chess XD

## What's needed?
3D printer, Filament(PLA), 100 Pcs coin magnets(Diameter: 6.00 mm, Height: 2.00mm)<br />
and nail clipper(???)<br />
  &emsp;I used a slanted edge nail clipper to remove extra filaments and that worked like a charm.

## Why did I make this?
I wanted a physical chess board, but didn't want to pay 

## What I learned
I think it's better to design things looser..?<br />
  &emsp;Initially I thought making things tighter and removing extra filaments might be better option<br />
  &emsp;But that just adds extra work(time) and using glue or just melting in more filament in was faster fix<br />
  &emsp;Specifically in my case, with my 3D printer (Anuycubic Kobra 2 Max), having things 1 mm leeway is generally a good idea.<br />

DO NOT TOUCH THE PRINTER WHILE PRINTING!!!!!!!!
  &emsp;I messed up the board because the printer was keep producing little blobs.<br />
  &emsp;So I kept pausing and removing those, BUT that must have mess up the location of the plate or something..<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;it was better to just leave the blobs.

## in the future
it might be cool to be able to take the board apart in 4 pieces for better storage<br />
  &emsp;I might just cut mine ðŸ˜³<br />
  &emsp;the magenets will keep them together when stacked<br />

# Version 1.1
The magnet slot was exactly 6.00 mm wide, which was too tight.<br />
My 3D printer trinted the slots as about 5.00 mm wide.<br />
So I updated them to be 7.00 mm wide.

# Version 1.0
Original design.
